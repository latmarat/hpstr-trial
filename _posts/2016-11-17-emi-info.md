I recently presented our work on Chord Length Distribution for quantification of microstructures at [EMI-2016 conference](http://www.lem3.fr/2016EMI-IC/) held in Metz. The slides are now available online [here](http://latmarat.net/blog/slides/emi-slides). Push 'F' for full screen mode and use ← and →  arrows for navigation.
