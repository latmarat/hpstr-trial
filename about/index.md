Hello and welcome!

# About me

My name is Marat I. Latypov, I am a materials scientist, data scientist, visualization and programming enthusiast. At the moment, I am a researcher at Georgia Tech Lorraine, the French campus of Georgia Institute of Technology, which I joined after receiving a PhD from POSTECH (South Korea).

The areas of my expertise include

- crystal plasticity
- finite element analysis of metal forming and micromechanics
- EBSD analysis
- statistical description and quantification of microstructures
- data-driven modeling of heterogeneous materials
- MATLAB and Python

At the moment, I am most excited about interactive visualization (e.g. D3.js) and data sciences.
